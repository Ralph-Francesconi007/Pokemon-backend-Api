# Pokemon Library Back End
This is the back end repo for my Pokemon library, this is where the front end makes requests and the back end responds with data about the request. Then back end is where the Pokemon gets created with the data that I send it, this is also where the Pokemon can get shown when I hit my "Get all Pokemon" button on the client itself. The back end was not an easy task to create but being able to complete it and knowing that I understand what to do when it comes to creating GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE routes makes everything easier. This is the link to the front end client repo, https://github.com/Ralph-Francesconi007/Pokemon-client.

# Planning Story
With this project, I took my time planning my time better and making better use of the application. Instead of diving right in head first like I did with my first project, the Tic-Tac-Toe client, I took a step back this time and made sure I knew what was happening before me. I knew that I needed to create the back end first and work my way up to the front end. That is exactly what I did, I created a Pokemon Schema and the Pokemon routes so that I could make requests to the api using AJAX on the front end. To test the routes to make sure they were working the way they are supposed to be, I used cURL scripts to create a Pokemon, to get all the Pokemon, to Update a Pokemon and to Delete a Pokemon. Once I knew everything was working the way it should be I could move to the client side and start making requests and making the web application.

# Unsolved Problems
  - Eventually I would like to create comment routes so that people can comment on Pokemon.
  - I would like to update my main Pokemon schema so that I can add more fields to the Pokemon itself.
